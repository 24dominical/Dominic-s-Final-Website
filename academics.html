	<p><h3>The ups of this year included:
	making new friends, having fun new experiences, and learning new subjects. 

	The cons of this year included: 
	the amount of pressure there is on juniors to do well, the difficulty of some classes, and the stress that schoolwork creates.

	Overall, the year went by very fast and most of my classes provided me with useful knowledge for the future. My classes included Computers, Science, History, English, Math, and Spanish</p>
